# Local composite actions

These are **local mirrors** (vendored copies) of composite actions from the
private [`pncit/shared-actions`](https://github.com/pncit/shared-actions) repo.

## Why they're copied here

`timezest` is a **public** repository. GitHub does not allow a public repo to
reference actions that live in a **private** repo, so it cannot `uses:`
`pncit/shared-actions/...` directly (the workflow fails with
`Unable to resolve action pncit/shared-actions, not found`). Copying the
actions into this repo under `.github/actions/` sidesteps that — a repo-local
action (`uses: ./.github/actions/<name>`) has no visibility restriction.

This mirrors how the sibling public repo
[`pncit/node-quickbooks`](https://github.com/pncit/node-quickbooks) handles the
same constraint — keep the two in step.

## Keeping them in sync (manual)

When an action changes in `pncit/shared-actions`, re-copy it here verbatim. The
copies are intentionally byte-for-byte identical to upstream (apart from the
header comment) so a sync is a trivial file diff — do **not** locally
"optimize" inputs or steps; consistency with upstream is the point.

| local action | upstream |
|---|---|
| `validate-codebase/action.yml` | `pncit/shared-actions/.github/actions/validate-codebase` |
| `verify-node-toolchain/action.yml` | `pncit/shared-actions/.github/actions/verify-node-toolchain` |
